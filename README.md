 Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

NAME: PATEL SUDIP ALPESHKUMAR

From this activity, I learned what makes a password strong and how to evaluate it using online password-strength checkers. I discovered that strong passwords use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and sufficient length. I also learned how weak patterns—such as short passwords, common words, repeated characters, or predictable sequences—make passwords easier to guess.

By testing different passwords with online strength tools, I saw how small changes (like adding symbols or increasing length) greatly improve the password score. Overall, I gained a better understanding of how to create more secure passwords and why complexity and length are important for protecting my accounts.
